# UMAP-Stratified Dataset Split
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.8+-blue)
> Stratified validation dataset splitting via UMAP‚Äëbased pseudo‚Äëlabels. A drop‚Äëin alternative to `torch.utils.data.random_split` that ensures each split preserves the manifold structure of your data.

***

## üìñ Overview

When you randomly split a dataset, you risk concentrating your validation set in a narrow region of feature space‚Äîespecially in small or highly clustered datasets. `umap-stratified-split` embeds your entire dataset with UMAP (with fixed seed), clusters the embedding into ‚Äúpseudo‚Äëlabels,‚Äù then performs stratified splitting to guarantee that each subset visits **all** manifold regions evenly.

This approach is grounded in the assumption that your dataset lies on a meaningful low-dimensional manifold and benefits from a uniform, structure-preserving sampling across this space.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Here is a typical usage example of the `umap_stratified_split` function and detailed explanations of its parameters:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
from umap_stratified_split.split import umap_stratified_split 

# Example: Define a simple dataset
class MyDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.data)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return self.data[idx]

# Create dataset (for example, 100 samples of 10-dimensional vectors)
data = [torch.randn(10) for _ in range(100)]
dataset = MyDataset(data)

# Optional: Define a feature extractor converting dataset items to numpy arrays
def feature_extractor(x):
    return x.numpy()  

# Define lengths of splits, e.g., 80% train, 20% val
lengths = [80, 20]

# Run the UMAP-stratified split
subsets = umap_stratified_split(
    dataset,
    lengths,
    feature_extractor=feature_extractor,  # optional
    n_neighbors=15,       # UMAP parameter: number of neighbors in graph
    min_dist=0.1,         # UMAP parameter: controls tightness of embedding clusters
    n_components=2,       # UMAP parameter: embedding dimension (usually 2 or 3)
    n_clusters_factor=10, # Controls number of clusters = n_splits * n_clusters_factor
    random_state=42       # For reproducibility
)

# subsets is a list of torch.utils.data.Subset objects, matching lengths
train_subset, val_subset = subsets

print(f"Train subset size: {len(train_subset)}")
print(f"Validation subset size: {len(val_subset)}")
```

## üß† Theoretical Motivation

This method builds on the foundation laid by the UMAP algorithm:

> **Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)** is a general-purpose nonlinear dimension reduction technique. Its core idea is to construct a graph-based fuzzy topological representation of data, then optimize a low-dimensional embedding that preserves local neighborhood structure [1].

UMAP relies on the following assumptions:

1. **The data is uniformly distributed on a Riemannian manifold**
2. **The Riemannian metric is locally constant** (or approximately so)
3. **The manifold is locally connected**

These assumptions allow UMAP to build a reliable low-dimensional embedding that captures meaningful cluster and density information [2].

By clustering the UMAP embedding and stratifying across those clusters, this package provides a principled way to sample validation and training sets that are *representative of the entire data manifold*.

***

## ‚úÖ Advantages of this Approach

- **Manifold-aware validation**: Ensures your validation set covers the same regions as your training set
- **Less validation bias**: Avoids selecting validation samples from narrow regions of the space
- **General-purpose**: Works for any data type (images, time series, embeddings, tabular, etc.)
- **Drop-in replacement**: Mimics the `random_split` API from PyTorch
- **Fully unsupervised**: Uses the geometry of the data, no true labels required
- **Reproducible**: UMAP seed and clustering make the split deterministic

***

## ‚ö†Ô∏è When to Use / Limitations

This method works best when:

- Your data lies on a structured manifold (e.g. clustered, continuous trajectories)
- The standard random split leads to class imbalance or structural bias
- You don‚Äôt have true labels, but want stratified-like splits based on learned structure

Avoid using this method if:

- Your data is completely uniform or already well-distributed
- You are splitting into a *test set* (risk of data leakage via unsupervised embedding)
- Your feature extractor or UMAP embedding fails to capture meaningful structure
